# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Site

A personal and educational site designed to help learners explore and understand fundamental data structures and algorithms. Built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shiki** for fast performance, beautiful styling, and server-rendered code highlighting.

## Features

- A growing list of data structures and algorithms
- Concise explanations and time/space complexity analysis
- Expandable sections with examples and implementation code
- Syntax-highlighted code snippets using Shiki
- Responsive and mobile-friendly UI with Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack
